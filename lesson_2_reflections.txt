How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Allows you to seperate out commits of related files, so you don't have to commit all the unchanged unrelated files in the working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Only add files that relate to that logical change, instead of commiting everything since the last commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

Creates a new commit on the checked out branch of the two branches merged to one. We represent it that way to tell how commits from each branch were put together.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    On teams or from multiple machines

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Lets you not overwrite things you may be wroking on locally, or publish
    things that aren't finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones on GitHub that refer to the original repository. Clones
    duplicate repositories. Branches are different lines of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you dont have internet you can still work with the latest remote copy later
    even if you dont need it now, and can merge it later.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Allows you to have things approved before merging, different work can be 
    put together, it's cloud based.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    In a production environment or a collaboration, different branches allow you 
    to keep the production code clean, and keep your code changes seperate from 
    other team members until it's time to share.
